# Run an nginx pod, upgrade the pod, rollback the deployment, record history.

## Pod upgrade
1. create a simple nginx pod
2. kubectl edit <podname>
3. change image name or whatever the update required
4. save and exit, pod upgrade start

## Deployment upgrade, recoard and rollback
1. create a simple deployment (say name of deployment is depnginx)
2. let's consider we need to change image of deployment 

  > podskubectl set image deployment/depnginx nginx=nginx:httpd --record  
  where -> deployment/<deployment name> <container name> = <new image name, or same image with new version>

3. check the history
  > kubectl rollout history deployment/depnginx 

4. more information about specific version in history
  > kubectl rollout history deployment/depnginx --revision=2 

5. go back to previous version
  > kubectl rollout undo deployment/depnginx

6. go back to specific version
  > kubectl rollout undo deployment/depnginx --to-revision=1

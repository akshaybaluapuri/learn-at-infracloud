- cluster setup (with Flannel for networking)
- basic image generation with docker
- kubectl basic commands for simple Pod, Deployment, Service 
- Types of service (ClusterIP,NodePort,Load Balancer)
- creating and using namespace
- Config map (creating and use by env var and volume mount)
- Security context (become specific user and group by runAsUser,fsGroup), secrets (using tham by env variable) ,Resource Requirements (limits)
- service account importance and how to use them in spec
- PV and PVC

- label selectors and annotations
- Edit deployments
- Roling update and roll back
- jobs and cronjobs
- network policy
- Liveness and Readiness Probes 

- different usecase of Liveness and Readiness Probes  and checking behavior of pod once condition fails (restart, and not farwarding traffic)
- Init continers (volume mount and data share, with job, with deployment)
- podpreset 
- pod-lifecycle, startup prob
- netwoiking fundamentals in pod, CNI, Importance of pause container 
- container lifecycle events (post start and pre stop) 
 
- DaemonSet
- replication controller and replicaset difference and usecases
- Assigning Pods to Nodes (nodeSelector)
? - statefulset (volumeClaimTemplates is included pods are not building, also wanted to know how to find cluster domain to determine specific pod by its domain name)
? - Deploy a pod which uses the nginx reverse proxy configuration from a configmap"



- working of DNS in kubernetes 
- Authentication and Authorization (users, strategies, RBAC)
- Logging and Monitoring -> Metrics server, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler,  Custom metrics pipeline
- ingress and its working (theoretically)

- Kubernetes PKI infrastructure
- Helm charts

- setting up Node exporter
- Graphana setup (simple deployment and service) and connect premetheus as data source
- PomQL  (data types, operators, functions)
- Instrumenting Applications (getting logs from a simple node js application to prometheus using kubernetes annotations, and checking those out in a grafana dashboard)


- PomQL from documentation relabel config syntax (Actions like labelmap)

- More experiments with pomql usecases and examples from diffetent blogs available 
- Querying prometheus using the HTTP API
